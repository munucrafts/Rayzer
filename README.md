# Rayzer â€“ A Simple CPU Ray Tracer

**Rayzer** is a simple CPU-based ray tracer designed to explore real-time rendering fundamentals like ray tracing, path tracing, ray-sphere intersection, material lighting, reflections, and roughness-based scattering, etc.

## Features

- Ray-sphere intersection.
- Recursive ray tracing with bounce depth.
- Material system (color, roughness, emission).
- Light direction shading.
- Accumulation buffer for denoising.
- Randomized scattering for rough surfaces.
- Soft background blending.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

- Add more material types (metal, dielectric, emissivenes).
- Multithreading for performance.
- Camera movement and rotation.
